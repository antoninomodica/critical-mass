## About
CriticalMass is a surround granular synthesizer based on the Boids flocking algorithm originally developed by Craig Reynolds. The audio engine is implemented in the visual programming language Max/MSP, while  swarming functionalities are based on JavaScript.

## Dependencies

- external objects library **spat** by IRCAM. Download https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/spat/

## Usage
In the top section of the main view it is possible to pick a folder containing the samples to be used in the synth. When a file is selected via the dropdown menu, its waveform is visualized right underneath it.
